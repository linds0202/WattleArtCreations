        <h1>Additional Revision Policy</h1>
        
        <p>We understand that creating the perfect custom art piece is a collaborative process, and sometimes, you may require a few adjustments to ensure your vision is accurately represented. At Wattle Art Creations, we prioritize your satisfaction and want you to be thrilled with the final artwork.</p>
        
        <p>Our standard commission process includes two free revisions on the final submitted piece. However, we know that each project is unique, and you may need additional revisions to achieve your desired result. That&apos;s why we offer a flexible option for additional revisions to accommodate your needs.</p>

        <h3>How to Request Additional Revisions</h3>

        <p>Discuss with Your Artist - If you&apos;ve already exhausted the included revisions and need further adjustments, communicate your concerns with the artist. They will provide guidance on how to proceed and what can be done to ensure your satisfaction. If you decide to proceed with additional revisions, they will be able to directly send you a purchase link. Please note that this payment is reserved alongside the original payment, and will only be released to the artist when you have made the final confirmation that you are happy and satisfied with the piece!</p>

        <p>Please note that additional revisions may impact the completion timeline of your artwork. We appreciate your understanding and patience as our artists work diligently to create the perfect custom piece for you.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to deliver an art piece that you&apos;ll be proud to showcase. If you have any questions or concerns about the Additional Revisions process, please contact us. (link to the contact us page)</p>
